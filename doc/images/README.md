## Design Guidelines

All diagrams should follow these guidelines:

1. Use consistent color scheme:
   - Primary blue (#1E88E5) for main components
   - Secondary green (#43A047) for data flows
   - Accent orange (#FB8C00) for highlighting key features
   - Light gray (#F5F5F5) for backgrounds

2. Use clear, readable fonts:
   - Titles: Roboto Bold, 16pt
   - Labels: Roboto Regular, 12pt
   - Annotations: Roboto Light, 10pt

3. Include a legend for complex diagrams

4. Maintain consistent iconography across all diagrams

## Adding New Images

When adding new images, please follow these steps:

1. Create your diagram using a vector graphics program (SVG format preferred)
2. Follow the design guidelines for consistency
3. Add appropriate metadata (title, description, date)
4. Update this README.md file to include your new image
5. Reference the image in the relevant documentation file

## Image Formats

- Use SVG format for diagrams and illustrations
- Use PNG format for screenshots (minimum 72dpi)
- Use JPEG format only for photographs (minimum 72dpi)

All images should be optimized for web viewing while maintaining quality.
